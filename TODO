* [0/7] > 0.0.9 version

- [ ] Macros can be loaded and applied to the configuration
- [ ] Actually support converging and idempotency (~--runmode=idempotent~)
  + Do not do an operation unless it is required
  + Abort in case there was a failure in executing the script.
  + This would work by using the ~:cache true~ to a block header argument
- [ ] Support for ~#+SETUPFILE~
- [ ] Heuristics for determining which binary to use for running the script
- [ ] Display how the run would look like without making changes
  : org-converge setupfile.org --dry-run
- [ ] Use :eval for evaling blocks (off by default)
- [ ] Can use :dir for running a process relative to that directory

* [1/1] 0.0.8 version

- [X] ~org-spec~ exploration!

* [2/2] 0.0.7 version

- [X] Add ~org-run~ and ~org-tangle~ aliases
- [X] Use rake task manager

* [3/3] 0.0.6 version

# - [ ] Keyword to accumulate run blocks
- [X] Run specific blocks defined by name (using a regex expression)
- [X] Change the format of the logger
- [X] Do not run blocks in commented headlines

* [2/2] 0.0.5 version

- [X] Do not run or tangle blocks without arguments
- [X] Keyword to activate runmode in the text itself

* [1/1] 0.0.4 version

- [X] Can use :mkdirp for 0644 permissions

* [2/2] 0.0.2 version of org-converge

Run the code blocks!

- [X] Code blocks are executed by default after tangling in temp dir
  Only when ~:shebang~ exists as an argument
- [X] Default parallel execution of blocks

* [3/3] 0.0.1 version

Need some basic functionality of what Org babel offers first.

- [X] Display files that were captured with command
  : org-converge setupfile.org --showfiles
- [X] ~:tangle~ puts the files in the correct path
- [X] ~--tangle~ flag
- [X] Support a root dir for when not running relative to the directory

* [6/21] Ideas
** TODO Chaining resources with ~#+NAME:~ directives and ~:notify~ argument

One idea is to be able to notify resources by naming the code blocks.

Example: Here first the td-agent service would try to start,
and if it succeeds, then it would execute the script defined in the
~announce-availability~ resource.

#+name: td-agent-start
#+begin_src sh :notify announce-availability
sudo service td-agent start
#+end_src

#+name: announce-availability
#+begin_src sh
sudo /etc/register-to-balancer
#+end_src

- Support for ~:before all~ and ~:after all~ added
** TODO Add namespace dynamically to the tasks using an in buffer setting

When including files there can be some potential scoping issues.

** TODO Inject macros within the environment variables from a runnable process
** TODO Clarify which ones of the header arguments to implement

http://orgmode.org/manual/Specific-header-arguments.html#Specific-header-arguments

** TODO Use sshkit for running remote processes
** TODO By default, it should use current dir for tangling
** TODO Converging: Only do an operation when it didn't finish

Hence the name of the project

** TODO For now we keep the indentation of the code blocks

The indentatin of the ~#+begin_src~ should always 
be at the beginning of the file, not at the indentation
level from when the file was written in Org mode.

** TODO We should have a whitelist of languages that can be executed and ignore everything

Under which heuristics or configuration should we decide which will be the 
binary that should be used to execute the block? Specify with shebang?

- For now, unless shebang is specified it will be executed.
  Then in the scripts buffer used ~index::shebang~ as a key.

** TODO Setting permissions from a tangled file

It should be possible to tangle the files this way:

#+begin_src conf :tangle etc/something/config/path :chmod 0664 :user td-agent :group td-agent
<source>
</source>
#+end_src

** TODO Adopting the ~#+SETUPFILE~ for loading a config that is done JSON or YAML

It seems that there is support for a ~#+SETUPFILE~

** TODO Something more flexible than macros:

One example of syntax that we could use instead of macros:

#+begin_src yaml :session
fluentd:
  port: 4224
  path: here.log
#+end_src

But need to 

** TODO Choosing a templating language: default for now is mustache

We could implement the macro systems, but it seems that it may not be
strong enough for providing with all the cases we may run into.
** TODO Support caching?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :cache yes :exports results
  (random)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[db54597aed193d861d01bf92110e10f28f8f40d4]:
: 842438499349743708

** TODO Support :eval ?

#+begin_src sh :eval (print "Really doing this...")
  echo "Going ahead with operation X!"
#+end_src

** DONE ~#+NAME:~ could be used in the logger for identifying the process
** DONE Managing dependencies: could be handled with ~#+include~ directives

One idea is that it would be useful to compile different manuals
that are dependent among each other. 

For example, the centralized logs server would require fluentd.
We should be able to express that dependency somehow:

#+begin_src org :tangle logserver.org
  ,#+include: "fluentd.org"
  
  ,* Setup the centralized logserver                                     :setup:
  
  ,Once the fluentd.org has been converged, we can build upon this and
  ,override the original config to make it particular for this logserver
#+end_src

# But one problem, is that once I have included something, sometimes we
# will want "reopen" the previous manuals?
** DONE We don't need to create the directories in most cases (:mkdirp yes)

Something like this is not required because the ~:tangle~ blocks
would create the necessary directories behind the scenes.

#+begin_src org
  ,We need to prepare some directories for the configuration:
  
  ,#+begin_src converge
  ,mkdir -p etc/fluentd/config
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src
** CANCELED How to set the permissions from the directory from the file that is being tangled when it does not exists?

By default, this would be 0644, but we also need to specify the
user:group of it so the syntax would have to be:

#+begin_src conf :tangle etc/something/config/path :chmod 0664 :user td-agent :group
hmm dont't like this syntax for folders
#+end_src

Let's keep it simple and just use a babel block that shells out to create the directories
until I can think of something better.

** CANCELED Using the :tags: to setup the things to run right away

Using the block ~#+name~ instead.

Kind of like the chef-solo runlist, a headline like this...

#+begin_src org
  ,* Everything in its right place                                      :config:
  
  ,#+begin_src conf :tangle etc/this.yml
  ,hello: "world"
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

...could be called like this

#+begin_src sh
org-converge fluentd.org -t config
#+end_src

** CANCELED Loading all the Org mode files first and then setup only one part

Used ~#+name~ from blocks instead.

So maybe, each one of these tags would have to be namespaces under the
name of the file:

: org-converge logserver.org -t "fluentd::setup, fluentd::config, logserver::setup"
