#+TITLE:   Expected results example
#+runmode: spec

Given a literate description of the run along with the expected
results, we can try checking whether the contents from the code block
are evaling into what is being documented in the results block.

#+name: hello
#+begin_src sh :results output code :exports both
for i in `seq 20`; do 
echo "hello"
done
#+end_src

.........

#+RESULTS: hello
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
hello

#+END_SRC

Something else.

#+name: hola
#+begin_src ruby :results output code :exports both
10.times do 
  puts "hola"
end
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: hola
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
