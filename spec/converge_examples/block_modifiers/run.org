#+TITLE: Code block modifiers

We have the following process, but it will take 5 seconds to start...

#+name: waits-5-seconds
#+begin_src sh :waitsfor 2
echo "Wait..."
for i in `seq 1 5`;
do
echo $i >> out.log
sleep 1
done
echo "Now done!"
#+end_src

This one on the other hand starts as soon as possible:

#+name: does-not-wait
#+begin_src sh 
echo "whoosh" > out.log
#+end_src
