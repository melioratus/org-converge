#+TITLE: Runlist example

In this example, we will have scripts being chained one after another.

#+begin_src sh :shebang #!/bin/bash
sleep 5
echo "first" > out.log
#+end_src

The script below will only be called once the one above is run.

#+begin_src ruby :shebang #!/usr/local/bin/ruby
File.open("out.log", 'a') {|f| f.puts "second" }
#+end_src
